# Simple Reflector

_Simple Reflector_ is a straightforward livestream proxy server written in TypeScript and runs
on node. The program utilizes the open source node-based Unifi Protect [Library](https://github.com/hjdhjd/unifi-protect) 
to fetch livestreams from a Unifi Protect Controller and relay them to the [Simple Player](../player) via WebSocket.
