    viewport streams

SYNOPSIS
    viewport streams [--layout LAYOUT] url...

DESCRIPTION
    This command displays video streams according to an (optional) layout. Video streams are
    specified as a URL, with any of the supported protocols.  This command uses  `ffmpeg` in
    the background to reflect the video streams to a Media Server, where they are transcoded
    to a format suitable for live web presentation (H.264 fMP4 or FLV). The exact processing
    pipeline depends on the protocol. Obviously, for the lowest possible latency, prefer  to
    use the native protocol of the NVR.

    (1) For the Unifi Protect low latency H.264 fMP4 video stream, use the 'unifi'
        protocol as follows:

        * To specify all cameras of a Unifi Protect Controller (i.e., UNVR):
          unifi://username:password@controller-address/_all

        * To specify specific cameras and/or layout order:
          unifi://username:password@controller-address/camera name 1, ...

    (2) For the Real Time Streaming Protocol,  use the 'rtsp' or 'rtsps' (secured)
        protocols.

    Note: When used in the terminal,  don't forget to  put a `'` (single quote)  around URLs
        with special characters in them, such as spaces (' '), commas (',') or  ampersands
        ('&') etc.

OPTIONS
    --layout=LAYOUT
            The layout to use. Supported layouts are: GRID, LMS and AUTO.

            (1) GRID layout generates a grid of evenly-sized cells, and is specified using
                ROWS x COLUMNS, i.e., --layout grid:3x4.

            (2) LMS layout is specified in terms of LARGE, MEDIUM and SMALL cells to house
                the videos streams, i.e., lms:1,2,4 will generate a layout with one  large
                -sized cell,  2 medium-sized cell  and 4 small-sized cells.  Note that not
                all combinations are possible.

            (3) AUTO layout tries to automatically generate a suitable layout.
